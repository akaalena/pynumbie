# PyNumbie
A tool that prints out an integer number between a given range 
but excluding selected numbers.

## Build
First, clone the repository from GitHub.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/akaalena/pynumbie.git
```

Then you should have a local copy of _PyNumbie_.
To use it, just navigate to the project directory and run the command.

```sh
cd pynumbie
python pynumbie/numbie.py -s 1 -e 15 -x 4 1 8 2 12
```

The last command runs _PyNumbie_ to return a number between 
1 and 15 omitting 4, 1, 8, 2, 12.
